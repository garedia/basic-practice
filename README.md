# basic-practice
This repository contains some practice scripts (some guided) for reference

Some of them are from walkthroughs on youtube that show the basics of numpy usage

Some are basic pandas usage

There are some challenge questions from edabit that have little interview question type challenges, just a few lines of code each

The purpose of this repository is just to hold reference materials
